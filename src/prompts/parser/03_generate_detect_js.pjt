Ok, I have this DOM element:

{{ first_article_html }}

Now, I want you to give me some JS based on this HTML, to detect and find all of the articles on this page, and extract the following JSON format for each:

{
    "name": "NoFilter Attack: Sneaky Privilege Escalation Method Bypasses Windows Security",
    "author": "Ron Ben Yizhak",
    "date": "Aug 17, 2023",
    "link": "https://thehackernews.com/2023/08/nofilter-attack-sneaky-privilege.html",
    "summary": "A previously undetected attack method called NoFilter has been found to abuse the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to achieve privilege escalation in the Windows operating system."
  }
