Given this HTML, which IS a real article:

{{ first_article_dom }}

And this HTML which is an Ad:

{{ first_possible_ad_dom }}

Please find the differences, and give me a test we can add to our JS to exclude articles that are really ads.  The detection JS code I want to add this to is this:

{{ parser_js }}
