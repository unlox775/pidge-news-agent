I am interested in staying up with the news on this:

{{ input }}

{% if human_input %}

  But my most important advice, is this.  Please pay close attention:

  {{ human_input }}

{% endif %}

Can you give me a JSON of a list of URLs of news sites I might have better luck using?
  
Please also give me a list of 2 or 3 search terms I could use on each search engine which might help me be more effective.  Please distinguish between sites that the home page is a list of articles that is already relevant (without needing a search term) and sites that require a search term to be effective to find the news we need.  Give this as a `type` value, one of:

- `no_search` - no search term needed
- `search_url` - meaning you are providing with a URL that has a `[TERM]` placeholder
- `search_page` - meaning this is a page I will need to load, find the search box, type in the search term, and click the search button

This is an example of what I am looking for when I am looking for "hacker exploits, especially mentions of SAAS companies that were hacked":

{
    "search_engines": {
        "Hacker News": {
            "type": "no_search",
            "url": "https://thehackernews.com/"
        },
        "Google News": {
            "type": "search_url",
            "url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=[TERM]&tbm=nws",
            "search_terms": [
                "hacker exploits",
                "saas hacks",
                "saas data breach",
            ]
        },
        "Symantec":{
            "type": "search_page",
            "url": "https://www.symantec.com/",
            "search_terms": [
                "saas",
                "data",
            ]
        }
    }
}
