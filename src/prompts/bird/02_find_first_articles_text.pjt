Please from this select All > Copy of a news web page, please find the first article, ignoring the header and any ads.  Give me a quick json of:

A json of {" first": ZZZ, "second": YYY} only the first 2 articles

Where ZZZ and YYY are this format:
{
    "article_name": "The amazing Flippy Fish",
    "first_few_words_of_each_piece_of_text_in_article_listing": [
        "Aug, 13, 2023", "A previously detected","Animal Articles"
    ]
}

We will be using these first-few-words in a moment in another script.  They just need to be actual excerpts of different parts of the article listing.
